### Data Structures in C

This repository contains C language implementations of the main data structures covered in the Algorithms and Data Structures course. The implementations were developed as part of my hands-on learning process and include sequential lists, linked lists, and other fundamental structures.

The goal is to reinforce concepts through practical application, using clean and organized code.
